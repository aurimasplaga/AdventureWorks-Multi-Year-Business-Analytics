# 1. Data Collection & Preparation

### Data Sources
- **Original Data Source:**  
  
  
### Data Cleaning & Transformation
- **Importing Data:**  
  Load the modified dataset from CSVs, Excel files, or directly from a database.
- **SQL-Based Data Cleaning:**  
  Use SQL queries to handle missing values, standardize formats, and filter out irrelevant entries.
- **Schema Development:**  
  Organize the cleaned data into a star schema, which optimizes the dataset for efficient querying and reporting.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using SQL  

### 🔍 Initial Analysis  
- **Descriptive Statistics:** SQL queries were used to compute averages, medians, and distributions for key metrics such as patient age, billing amounts, and length of stay.  
- **Data Aggregation:** Grouped data by demographics (age, gender, blood type) to identify cost patterns and severity trends.  

### 📌 Sample SQL Query  
```sql

```
### Sample Query Results (Limit of 15)


## 3. Visualization with Power BI

### Dynamic Dashboard with Bookmarks
